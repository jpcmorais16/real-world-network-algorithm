# A simple and flexible algorithm to generate real-world networks

## This repository contains the implementation of an algorithm designed to generate undirected graphs with three key characteristics often observed in real-world networks, using random walks and iteratively adding edges based on a probability distribution:
### 1) Scale-freeness: Long-tailed degree distributions where a few nodes have significantly more connections than others.
### 2) Small-world phenomenon: Short average distances between nodes.
### 3) High clustering coefficients: Nodes form tightly knit communities.
